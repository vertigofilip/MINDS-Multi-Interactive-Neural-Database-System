# MINDS-Multi-Interactive-Neural-Database-System
MINDS is a project aimed at creating reliable and powerful open-source AI. To do so it project is going to use many AI modules and scripts connected by a database and exchange information by using different database entries. This will allow to to teach logic and information severalty as well as let AI analyze the information it is being provided. This will also allow generating a lot of training material using algorithms that utilize this data the AI is going to work on.

The AI is going to have different versions classified based on the database. The simple version is going to be based on sql database with a simple structure and is going to be the first one to be implemented as a proof of concept.

The entire project is based AI elements acting on database creating, modifying and deleting those elements. This will facilitate the breakdown of information, tasks, etc. and their combinations and individual analyses.
