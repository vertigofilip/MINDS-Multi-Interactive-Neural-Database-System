# MINDS-Multi-Interactive-Neural-Database-System

## Overview
MINDS is an ambitious open-source project focused on developing a robust, modular AI system. Our goal is to construct a powerful artificial intelligence framework that leverages a constellation of AI modules and scripts, interconnected through a flexable database infrastructure. 
This will help to work on data in more flexable whay by allowing to cobine, devide and modify data and intentions freely in order to better ynderstand them and act on them in more advansed whay.
This system is designed to facilitate the seamless exchange of information, enabling advanced logic teaching and data analysis capabilities, as well as separating data from logic. 
By harnessing diverse AI algorithms, MINDS aims to generate an extensive repository of training materials, enriching the AI's learning process and operational efficiency.

## Architecture
At the heart of MINDS is its modular design, where each component or module operates on a shared database to perform various tasks such as data creation, modification, and deletion. This architecture not only simplifies the breakdown and analysis of information but also enhances the system's flexibility and scalability including fsilitating of distributed computing, and ease of starting the priject.

## Versioning
MINDS will evolve through multiple versions, each distinguished by its underlying database architecture and complexity:

Simple Version: The initial proof of concept will utilize an SQL database with a straightforward schema, laying the groundwork for more complex iterations.

## Getting Started
The project doesn't have any working prototype yet, but we are working on that.

## Contributing
We warmly welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're interested in fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, your help is invaluable to MINDS. Please refer to our CONTRIBUTING.md for detailed information on how to get started.
