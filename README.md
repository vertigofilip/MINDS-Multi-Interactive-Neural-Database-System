# MINDS-Multi-Interactive-Neural-Database-System
This AI project aims to create a powerful, adjustable, and flexible and open source multi model AI assistant, that can be integrated into many applications including internet research, fact-checking and peer review.


This multi model neural network is in very early development. The idea of this AI is changing constantly. Current two files are retraining data for existing AI I want to used to accelerate progress. They separate understanding of text from understanding of tasks required from AI in order to create different input modes for safety. In its current form input text is intended to be provided to both neural networks, however it is going to be changed in the future to working in line in order to allow this one neural network to interact with different forms of input. The entire AI is going to work based on database containing elements with fields 'type', 'name', 'information', and 'source'. The types of those are going to be: 'goal', 'memory, 'knolage'. The networks and scripts working on them are going to be decided into input, maintenance and output nodes. Input nodes are going to create database elements based on input, maintenance are going to create, delete, and modify them in order to process information, analyze them and modify behavior of AI, and output are going to generate output based on the database elements.
