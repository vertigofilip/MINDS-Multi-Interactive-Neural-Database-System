# MINDS-Multi-Interactive-Neural-Database-System
MINDS is project aimed at creating reliable and powerful open source AI. In order to do so it project is going to use many AI modules and scripts connected by database and exchanging information by using different database entries. This will allow to to teach logic and information severalty as well as let AI analyze information it is being provided. This will also allow to generate a lot of training material using algorithms than utilize this to data the AI is going to work on.

The AI is going to have deferent versions classified based on database. Simple version is going to be based on sql database with simple sructure and is goin to be first one to be implemented as proof of concept.

The entire project is based AI elements acting on database creating, modifying and deleting those elements. This will facilitate breakdown of information, tasks, etc. and their combinations and individual analyses.
