# MINDS-Multi-Interactive-Neural-Database-System

## Overview
MINDS is an ambitious open-source project focused on developing a robust, modular AI system. Our goal is to construct a powerful artificial intelligence framework that leverages flexibility of database to store and facilitate work on data and a constellation of AI modules and scripts, interconnected through a said database infrastructure.
This will help to work on data in more flexible way by allowing to combine, divide and modify data and intentions freely in order to better understand them and act on them in more advanced way.
This system is designed to facilitate the seamless brake down, analysis, gathering and exchange of information, enabling advanced data and task analysis capabilities, as well as separating data from logic.
By separating logic and data, es well as dividing this logic into smaller more dedicated packages this project hopeful will active greater accuracy with less effort by being able to teach separate neural networks the specific part of analysis or even create script to do so.

## Architecture
At the heart of MINDS is database enabling AI to analyze the data and tasks in a deeper way and us to generate the learning material using scripts. This method will help us develop this faster and with (hopefully) less use of controversial learning material. This will also help to avoid teaching it our biases and misconceptions, because our training data will be based on abstract and non-controversial data that hopefully will make it easy to avoid all of those problems.

## Versioning
MINDS will evolve through multiple versions, each distinguished by its underlying database architecture and complexity:

Simple Version: The initial proof of concept will utilize an SQL database with a straightforward schema, laying the groundwork for more complex iterations.

Advanced Version: Next version is planed to use hierarchical database to help in encapsulate different complexities in language using structure of said database.

## Getting Started
The project doesn't have any working prototype yet, but we are working on that.

## Contributing
We warmly welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're interested in fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, your help is invaluable to MINDS. Please refer to our CONTRIBUTING.md for detailed information on how to get started.
